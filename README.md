# taskman
This app aims to recreate the windows 10 task manager in Qt. I will hopefully port this to QML to make it look more faithful to the original one. 
I may also move this to QML in the future if that works better. 

Ultimate goal is to have this as a KDE system monitor because I like the windows one much more than plasma
